          The programme's objective is employability. Hence, PGC will emphasize skill competencies and on-the-job training as the core focus of the delivery. For this purpose, we will use the CPT (Curricular Practical Training) methodology, where students will primarily be employed, and their employment experience will be carefully vetted and validated as training. The first semester (4-5 months) will include lectures, classroom practicals, and demonstrations, which students must attend according to the class schedules (full-time or part-time). Some modules may be delivered fully or partially through video presentations. The PGC Education management team oversees industrial training in collaboration with major private healthcare institution networks. PGC Education Academy reserves the right to change the venue, date, and time for some modules and practicals, but such changes will not exceed 30% of the entire programme.
